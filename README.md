# Digit_Recognization
This project provides a Python implementation for digit recognition using the K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. By utilizing the power of the scikit-learn (sklearn), numpy, and matplotlib libraries, this project enables accurate classification of handwritten digits.

Key Features:

K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm: The project implements the KNN algorithm, a simple yet effective classification algorithm. KNN assigns labels to data points based on the majority vote of their nearest neighbors in the feature space. In the context of digit recognition, KNN compares the test image with a database of labeled training images to determine the digit label.

Feature Extraction and Preprocessing: The project provides utilities to extract relevant features from digit images, such as pixel intensities or shape descriptors. Additionally, it includes preprocessing techniques like scaling or normalization to ensure consistent and accurate comparisons between images.

Model Training and Testing: The implementation facilitates the training of the KNN model on a labeled dataset of handwritten digits. It also enables the testing of the trained model on unseen digit images, evaluating its classification accuracy and performance.

Dataset Handling: The project includes utilities to load and preprocess the popular MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The MNIST dataset consists of a large number of labeled digit images, making it ideal for training and evaluating the KNN model.

Performance Evaluation: The project utilizes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the digit recognition model. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify digits and its overall effectiveness.

Visualization: The project leverages the matplotlib library to visualize digit images and their corresponding labels. This allows users to gain a better understanding of the dataset and visually inspect the results of the digit recognition process.

Customization and Extensibility: The modular code structure allows for easy customization and extension. Users can experiment with different parameter settings, explore alternative distance metrics, or incorporate additional features to improve the accuracy and robustness of the digit recognition model.
